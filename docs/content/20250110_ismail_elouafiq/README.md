We will talk about how we've run a glucose monitoring pilot in Uppsala
using an open citizen science approach.
Some of the challenges and learnings we've had.
And more upcoming projects and ideas,
from simple experiments to synthetic biology,
to help all kinds of people rediscover the joy of figuring things out.
