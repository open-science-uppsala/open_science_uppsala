Open Science Community Uppsala is the local Uppsala Open Science community
that discusses the pros and cons of Open Science
by means of discussing papers and inviting speakers.

The goal of Open Science Community Uppsala is:

- to **teach** one another about Open Science (e.g. by reading papers)
- to **discuss** Open Science
- using **English** as the main language (i.e. most presentations are English)
- **regularily** (e.g. once a month)
- for **everyone** (i.e. non-scientists are also welcome)
- in **Uppsala** (i.e. in-person meetings)
- for **free** (i.e. everyone can afford to participate)
- at a **public location** (i.e. non-scientists can reach the venue)
- in a **scholarly** way (i.e. we embrace the scientific method in our discussions)

We do so by [organizing activities](activities.md)
especially people presenting an aspect of Open Science.
