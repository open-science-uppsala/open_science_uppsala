# Description

This talk was presented to the Open Science Uppsala community in Uppsala, Sweden on 10 March 2023. It was presented by Wolmar Nyberg Åkerström (NBIS) on behalf of the Data management team at the National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden (NBIS).

## Description of the talk

The premise of this talk is that code, research software and computational workflows are important research assets that can be recognised as valuable research outputs. The presentation elaborates on how the outputs fit into the broader research context using examples of practices from the biomolecular life sciences.
