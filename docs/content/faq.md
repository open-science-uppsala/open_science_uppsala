## Open Science

### What is Open Science?

There are multiple definitions,
here is one from [the UNESCO Open Science toolkit](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000387983.locale=en)

> Open science is a set of principles and practices that aim to make scientific
> research from all fields accessible to everyone for the benefits of
> scientists and society as a whole. For example, scientists and engineers can
> use open licenses to share their publications, data, software and hardware
> more widely—not only with each other but also with the rest of society.
> Open science is about making sure not only that scientific knowledge is
> accessible but also that the production of that knowledge itself is
> inclusive, equitable and sustainable.

### Which literature do you recommend?

- [Search Google Scholar for 'Open Science'](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=sv&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=open+science&btnG=)

## Open Science Community Uppsala

### What is the goal of Open Science Community Uppsala?

- to **teach** one another about Open Science (e.g. by reading papers)
- to **discuss** Open Science
- using **English** as the main language (i.e. most academic papers are English)
- **regularily** (e.g. once a month)
- for **everyone** (i.e. non-scientists are also welcome)
- in **Uppsala** (i.e. in-person meetings)
- for **free** (i.e. everyone can afford to participate)
- at a **public location** (i.e. non-scientists can reach the venue)
- in a **scholarly** way (i.e. we embrace the scientific method in our discussions)

### What activities does Open Science Community Uppsala organize?

Activities by OSCU are, among others:

- Discussing Open Science papers
- Speakers that discuss an aspect of Open Science

See 'Activities' :-)

[Contact us](contact_us.md)
if you want to organize or participate in activities.

### Do I need to register for activities?

No.

You are always welcome :-)

### How can I follow Open Science Community Uppsala?

See [Follow us](follow.md) on how to follow us.

### Why is Open Science Community Uppsala at the Stadsbibliotek? Why not at the university?

Because the meetings are intended to be open to everyone
that wants to discuss the scientific method in general
and Open Science in particular.

### What will not be accepted in discussions?

- *Ad hominem* reasoning: instead, discuss the content of the argument instead
- Conspiracy theories (e.g. 'All scientists are corrupt'): instead,
  discuss what the academic literature states on scientists' behavior
- Anecdotal evidence: instead, refer to scientific studies
  and/or reviews. Of course, throwing in a personal story is OK,
  using it as a irrefutable proof is scholarly no-go.

### How many people visit each event?

See [the 'data' section](../data/README.md), where you can find all data.
